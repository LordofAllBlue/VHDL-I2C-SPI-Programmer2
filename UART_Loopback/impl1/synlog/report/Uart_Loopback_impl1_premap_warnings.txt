@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\szabo ferenc\documents\fpga projects\uart_loopback\uart_tx.vhd":38:1:38:2|Found inferred clock Int_Osc|Clk_inferred_clock which controls 270 sequential elements including U2.StateV[0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
